On this project i've managed to learn a couple of advanced concepts about not only typescript but also
programming as a whole.

# Factory Pattern
This pattern on this project consists of having a generic database data can be dynammicaly create a reused depending on the
interface at which it is created.

# Singleton Pattern
Having a single static instance of a given object for your project to use, so you don't have to worry about the problems that comes
with having to manage multiple instances of something.

# Visitor Pattern
The most classic way to describe a visitor pattern is to think about forEach, it's an abstraction that makes you visit a dataset to act
on each of it's values, so you don't have to think about imutability and changing the dataset.
You only need to think about manipulating the data.

# Strategy Pattern
When you create an implementation to solve a given problem that will return a given value based on a specified value property, so
whoever uses the implementation will have to worry about only passing through the field of which to return set value.

# Observer Pattern
The famous pub/sub that can be used anywhere where reactive programming exists, it consists of having a given observable that can have
x amount of subscriptions, and when that value changes, all subscribers get notified with the updated/old value to act on it.
